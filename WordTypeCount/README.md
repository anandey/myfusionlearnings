For example, in the above screen, we could see the input string "This is to count number of occurrences of each word in a given String". When the button "Count Words" is pressed, it will display the result in the output text box as shown in the screen in which we could see each word of the given input string and count of their occurrences. And also we could see at the end of the result, the total count (shown with the word "Size") of words in the input string.
